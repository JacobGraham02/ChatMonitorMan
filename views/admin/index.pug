             | Welcome to the Scum Chat Monitor web interface, #{user.admin_username}.
            p.welcome_to_scumbot_interface_paragraph This website interface is currently in-progress, and is lacking certain features. Right now, you can only view a list of commands and click a button to recompile an executable to use for the application. You can access these buttons on the menu on the left-hand side of the screen if on a computer. If you are on a mobile device, please access this functionality from the hamburger menu (3-horizontal bars) at the top of your screen. 
            p.welcome_to_scumbot_interface_paragraph The <span id="welcome_to_scumbot_interface_bot_command_list_button_span">Bot commands</span> button brings you to a page  that lists all of the commands available to the bot. The edit functionality does not currently work, and you can only add commands.
